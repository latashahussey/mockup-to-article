Your response goes here!

It was not difficult at all. Because I've already had a ton of experience using
HTML, it was super easy.

I did, however, learn some new tags: the strike and sup. Never had a use for
them, but I'm glad they exist.

If I do run into something that I'm not sure about I usually Google it or check
W3 Schools for additional help.
